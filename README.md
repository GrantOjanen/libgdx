OpenGL (ES) that works on Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, Android, your
WebGL enabled browser and iOS.

### Downloads
As we switched to Gradle, there's no need to download libGDX itself anymore. For those of you who still prefer the old way of doing things, you can get libGDX from the [official download site](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/download.html).

### Documentation
The [Wiki](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki) contains all the information you'll need to write a 
libGDX game. You can contribute to the Wiki directly here on GitHub!

We also provide [Javadocs](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/nightlies/docs/api/) online. The Javadocs are
also bundled as source Jars with every libGDX distribution for consumption in your favorite IDE.

### News & Community
You can follow the latest news about libGDX on the [blog](http://www.badlogicgames.com). Follow
[@badlogicgames](https://twitter.com/badlogicgames) for real-time updates.

You can get help on our [forum](http://badlogicgames.com/forum/) and talk to other libGDX 
users on our IRC channel #libgdx at irc.freenode.net.

Another way of getting help or talking to other libGDX users is the [libgdx discord](https://discord.gg/6pgDK9F).

### Reporting Issues
Use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues?page=1&state=open) here on GitHub to report issues. Make sure you read the 
[Getting Help](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Getting-help) article that walks you through
the process or properly reporting an issue.

### Contributing & Working from Source
libGDX has a strong developer community constantly improving the code base. We love to
get any and all help we can. The [Contributing](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Contributing) 
article describes the process of helping libGDX to become even better.

To contribute, you need to work with libGDX' sources directly, something normal users do not
have to go through. The [Working with the Source](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Running-demos-%26-tests)
article will give you directions.

You can also contribute financially to our infrastructure (build server, web server, test devices) via our [Patreon](http://patreon.com/libgdx)!

can use it free of charge, without strings attached in commercial and non-commercial projects. We love to
get (non-mandatory) credit in case you release a game or app using libgdx!
